        "This book is dedicated, in respect and admiration, to the spirit that lives in the computer.", 
        "Educators, generals, dieticians, psychologists, and parents program. Armies, students, and some societies are programmed.",
        "To appreciate programming as an intellectual activity in its own right you must turn to computer programming; you must read and write computer programs -- many of them. It doesn't matter much what the programs are about or what applications they serve.",
        "Using Lisp we restrict or limit not what we may program, but only the notation for our program descriptions.",
        "The source of the exhilaration associated with computer programming is the continual unfolding within the mind and on the computer of mechanisms expressed as programs and the explosion of perception they generate.",
        "If art interprets our dreams, the computer executes them in the guise of programs!",
        "Since large programs grow from small ones, it is crucial that we develop an arsenal of standard program structures of whose correctness we have become sure -- we call them idioms -- and learn to combine them into larger structures using organizational techniques of proven value.",
        "These techniques are treated at length in this book, and understanding them is essential to participation in the Promethean enterprise called programming.",
        "Unlike programs, computers must obey the laws of physics. If they wish to perform rapidly -- a few nanoseconds per state change -- they must transmit electrons only small distances (at most 1 1/2 feet).",
        "Our traffic with the subject matter of this book involves us with three foci of phenomena: the human mind, collections of computer programs, and the computer.",
        "Every computer program is a model, hatched in the mind, of a real or mental process. These processes, arising from human experience and thought, are huge in number, intricate in detail, and at any time only partially understood."]
