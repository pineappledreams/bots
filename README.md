*Psst, try clicking the cover.*

This is the dailySICP twitter bot made by [pineappledreams](https://github.com/pineappledreams) for just a fun little project.  

What does it do?  

It posts a quote from the Structures and Interpretation of Computer Programs made by Sussmann and Abelson. It's just a quick and fun little project that I madea as a proof of concept that I can make a bot all by my own. And damn it, I did!  

You too can make a bot and it's really simple to do with the help of the botwiki and glitch community. Just look at the links below.  

I gave this project a little facelift ;)  

Well, what are you waiting for? [Click here to start reading SICP, mate!!!](https://mitpress.mit.edu/sites/default/files/sicp/full-text/book/book.html)
